# Hybrid-Bandwidth-Adaptive-Compression-Using-Huffman-and-Shannon-Fano-Coding
A hybrid compression pipeline combines bandwidth estimation (IBW, SEF), adaptive quantization, and entropy coding (Huffman and Shannonâ€“Fano) to efficiently compress signals. It ensures maximum data reduction while maintaining signal fidelity, supporting scalable and low-power transmission for healthcare and IoT applications.
